**Python** implementation is presented here for calculating correct histogram uncertainty. If you have any question about the approach and implementation, please email rezvande@ualberta.ca.

**There is unavoidable uncertainty in the representative histogram required as an input for geostatistical modeling. This uncertainty should be quantified correctly and incorporated into final modeling because it affects resource/reserve estimation, investment and development decisions. This works confirms a correct approach of quantifying histogram uncertainty by comparing to reference uncertainty found by an automated scan-based approach. Similar patterns of a data configuration are found within a large image and the mean of the specified domain is directly calculated. The correct quantification of histogram uncertainty is defined. The spatial bootstrap provides prior uncertainty that does not consider the domain limits and is not conditioned to the data.  This uncertainty is updated in geostatistical modeling to consider the limits and data. The resulting uncertainty closely matches the scan based approach.**
